# audio_emotion_detection
The case study is emotion classification using audio data. We try teaching the machine to understand the emotion os the speaker.
Varies techniques are used to help machine understand the emotion.
First, we try understanding the data (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Second, we build a baseline model (Baseline model)
Third, we use augmentation technique to improve the performance(Model with Augmented Data)
Fourth, we use advanced techniques to build a high performance model(Model with Advance techniques)
